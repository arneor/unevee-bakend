# Unevee Fitness API → Frontend Reference

This guide documents the public REST endpoints exposed by the NestJS backend. Share it with frontend engineers so everyone has the same expectations for request payloads, responses, pagination, and error codes.

---

## Base URLs & Versioning

- **Production**: `https://unevee-bakend.onrender.com`
- **Local**: `http://localhost:3000`
- All APIs are currently **public** – no auth headers required.
- Versioning is planned; for now the routes sit under the root (`/programs`, `/workouts`, `/diets`).

---

## Common Behaviors

- **Pagination**  
  Any `GET` list endpoint supports `page` and `limit` query params. Defaults: `page=1`, `limit=10`, maximum limit is 100. Response includes `{ data, total, page, limit }`.

- **Filtering**
  List endpoints support additional filtering query params for more targeted results:
  - Programs: `difficulty_level`, `min_duration`, `max_duration`
  - Workouts: `difficulty`, `min_duration`, `max_duration`
  - Diets: `orgId`, `difficulty_level`, `min_calories`, `max_calories`

- **Validation & Errors**  
  Our global validation pipe whitelists payload properties. Sending unknown fields returns `400` with:

  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 400,
    "message": ["property someField should not exist"],
    "error": "Bad Request"
  }
  ```

- **Identifiers**
  - `_id`: MongoDB ObjectId.
  - `program_id`, `diet_id`: external string IDs generated elsewhere (programs) or by the service (diets).
  - Detail routes accept `_id` **or** the feature-specific id/slug (see endpoint notes).

---

## Programs API

### GET `/programs`

- **Description**: Fetch paginated list of fitness programs.
- **Query Params**
  | Param | Type | Default | Notes |
  |-------|------|---------|-------|
  | `page` | number | 1 | page index |
  | `limit` | number | 10 | max 100 |
  | `difficulty_level` | string | - | filter by difficulty (e.g., "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced") |
  | `min_duration` | number | - | minimum program duration in days |
  | `max_duration` | number | - | maximum program duration in days |
- **Sample Requests**
  ```
  GET /programs?page=1&limit=5
  GET /programs?difficulty_level=Beginner&min_duration=7&max_duration=30
  ```
- **Sample Response**
  ```json

## Tips For Frontend Integration

1. **Always log pagination metadata** – you’ll need it for infinite scroll or next-page buttons.
2. **Treat stats as read-only** except via the dedicated stats endpoints (e.g., `PATCH /workouts/:id/stats`).
3. **Slug support** – detail endpoints for programs, workouts, and diets accept both `_id` and slug/external ids; use whichever your routing prefers.
4. **Diet slugs** – service auto-appends a timestamp suffix when generating slugs to keep them unique; store the slug from the response rather than re-computing it on the client.
5. **Diet editing flows** – prefer `PATCH` for simple status toggles, `PUT` only when replacing the full payload.
6. **Optimistic UI** – if you optimistically increment stats on the client, still call the backend so the database stays accurate.

Need another endpoint or field documented? Ping the backend team; we’ll update this doc as features grow.
